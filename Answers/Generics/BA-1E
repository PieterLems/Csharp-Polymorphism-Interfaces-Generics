      In this simplified version of Patience your goal is to
      complete the foundation pile. This pile is complete when
      it has, from top to bottom, the 4 of Spades, 3 of Spades,
      2 of Spades, 1 of Spades and the Ace of Spades.
      
      Keep in mind these rules:
      - you may not place cards on top of the deck;
      - on ordinary piles (pile1 and pile2), you may only place
        red cards (Hearts and Diamonds) on top of black cards
        (Spades and Clubs) and vice versa.
